# cosc442-supervised-systems

This is the second paper for the course COSC442 Natural Language Processing, which evaluates a Bayesian classifier against a BERT classifier for the SemEval-2019 shared task.

The OLID dataset used for training and testing can be found in the `OLID` directory.

`bayes.py` and `bert.py` are implementations of the Bayesian classifier and BERT classifier respectively.

`eval.py` is the shared function for evaluating the two systems.

The final report can be found in the PDF `Supervised_System_Evaluation_Report.pdf`
